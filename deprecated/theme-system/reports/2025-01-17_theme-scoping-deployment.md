**Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Time**: Deployment Complete  
**Target**: FoundryVTT v13 Container (localhost:30000)

## Deployment Summary

Successfully rebuilt and deployed the theme scoping fixes following the proper workflow.

### Build Process âœ…
- **Clean**: Removed all previous `dist/` artifacts
- **SCSS**: Compiled `styles/avant.scss` â†’ `dist/styles/avant.css` with source maps
- **TypeScript**: Compiled and bundled all TS files with Vite (509ms build time)
- **Packs**: Generated 4 compendium packs (17 total items)
- **Validation**: All 7 paths validated, all partials found, all templates valid

### Deployment Process âœ…
- **Files Copied**: 1.91MB successfully copied to container
- **Container Restart**: foundry-vtt-v13 restarted and healthy
- **Status**: Container running at localhost:30000

### Key Changes Deployed

1. **SCOPED Theme Manager**
   - Only targets specific selectors: `.avant-feature-card`, `.avant.sheet.actor`, `.avant.sheet.item`
   - No more full window theming
   - Enhanced logging with "SCOPED MODE" indicators

2. **Improved Detection Logic**
   - More restrictive `isAvantApplication` method
   - Specific element validation in mutation observer
   - Precise targeting to prevent interference with Foundry core UI

3. **Documentation Added**
   - `docs/THEMING_CAPABILITIES.md` for future reference
   - Full window theming capability preserved but scoped

### Testing Ready ðŸŽ¯

The system is now ready for testing at **localhost:30000** with:
- âœ… Scoped theme application (feature cards + actor sheets only)
- âœ… No interference with Foundry core interface
- âœ… All previous functionality preserved
- âœ… Enhanced logging for debugging

### Expected Behavior

**What SHOULD be themed:**
- Chat feature cards (`.avant-feature-card`)
- Actor sheets (`.avant.sheet.actor`)
- Item sheets (`.avant.sheet.item`)
- Theme manager UI (`.avant-theme-manager`)

**What should NOT be themed:**
- Foundry toolbar, sidebar, menus
- Other modules' UI elements
- Core Foundry dialogs and windows
- Chat messages (except feature cards within them)

### Next Steps

1. Test theme switching at localhost:30000
2. Verify only intended elements receive theming
3. Confirm no interference with core Foundry functionality
4. Post feature cards in chat to test chat theming
5. Open actor/item sheets to test sheet theming

**Status: READY FOR TESTING** ðŸš€
