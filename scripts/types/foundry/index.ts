/**
 * Local FoundryVTT Type Library - Index
 * 
 * ðŸš¨ FUTURE EXTRACTION TARGET: This entire `foundry/` directory is designed 
 * to be extracted as a standalone `foundry-types-v13` npm package when ready
 * for community release (Stage 4-C).
 * 
 * Current Location: avantVtt/scripts/types/foundry/ (Variant B - In-place)
 * Future Location: packages/foundry-types-v13/ (Variant A - Monorepo package)
 * 
 * Minimal, clean foundry-types-v13 replacement targeting FoundryVTT v13.341+
 * 
 * This library provides essential FoundryVTT type definitions without the
 * complexity and overhead of the community fvtt-types package.
 * 
 * Size Target: <50KB total (vs 500KB+ from fvtt-types)
 * Philosophy: "Thin-Core" - Only types we actually use
 * 
 * EXTRACTION CHECKLIST (for Stage 4-C):
 * - [ ] Move foundry/ â†’ packages/foundry-types-v13/src/
 * - [ ] Create package.json with npm workspace configuration
 * - [ ] Update import paths throughout avantVtt codebase
 * - [ ] Add build scripts for declaration files (.d.ts generation)
 * - [ ] Configure semantic versioning and release automation
