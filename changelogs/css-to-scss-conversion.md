# CSS to SCSS Conversion Changelog

## Date: 2024-12-19

## Summary
Converted `avantVtt/styles/avant.css` to SCSS format (`avant.scss`) while maintaining identical output styles and backwards compatibility with FoundryVTT v12.

## Changes Made

### 1. SCSS Variables
- Converted CSS custom properties to SCSS variables for internal use
- Maintained CSS custom properties in output for FoundryVTT v12 compatibility
- Created comprehensive variable system for:
  - Colors (primary, secondary, accent, text colors)
  - Typography (font families, sizes, weights)
  - Spacing (consistent spacing scale from xs to xxl)
  - Shadows and gradients

### 2. Mixins Created
- `@mixin box-sizing-border-box` - For v12 compatibility forced box-sizing
- `@mixin transition-standard` - Standard 0.3s ease transitions
- `@mixin orbitron-header($size, $weight)` - Orbitron font styling
- `@mixin exo-body($size, $weight)` - Exo 2 font styling
- `@mixin form-input-base` - Base form input styling with focus states
- `@mixin button-base` - Base button styling with hover effects
- `@mixin section-base` - Standard section styling pattern

### 3. Code Organization
- Organized styles into logical sections:
  - Variables and mixins at the top
  - Base `.avant` class styles
  - Window and layout components
  - Header and navigation components
  - Sidebar and stat components
  - Form elements and skills
  - Items and combat sections
  - Responsive design
  - Print styles

### 4. SCSS Features Utilized
- Nested selectors for better organization
- Variable interpolation with `#{}`
- Ampersand selector (`&`) for pseudo-classes and modifiers
- Consistent use of variables throughout
- Mixins for repeated patterns

### 5. Backwards Compatibility
- Maintained all CSS custom properties for FoundryVTT v12 compatibility
- Preserved exact selector specificity
- No changes to class names or structure
- Compiled CSS output is identical to original

### 6. Best Practices Applied
- Consistent variable naming with descriptive prefixes
- Logical nesting depth (max 3-4 levels)
- Reusable mixins for common patterns
- Organized imports and structure
- Comprehensive commenting

## Files Modified
- **Added**: `avantVtt/styles/avant.scss` - New SCSS source file
- **Updated**: `avantVtt/styles/avant.css` - Compiled from SCSS (identical output)

## Technical Notes
- SCSS compilation verified with `npx sass`
- All original functionality preserved
- Maintains FoundryVTT v12 compatibility requirements
- Ready for future maintenance and expansion

## Benefits
1. **Maintainability**: Variables and mixins make updates easier
2. **Consistency**: Centralized design tokens ensure consistency
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new components using existing patterns
4. **Developer Experience**: Better organization and readability
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend and modify design system

## Usage
To compile SCSS to CSS:
```bash
npx sass styles/avant.scss styles/avant.css
```

The conversion maintains 100% backwards compatibility while providing a much more maintainable and organized codebase for future development.
