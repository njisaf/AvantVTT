# Spec 06.1 Â· Action Roll Summaries
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active

## 1. Summary
This specification details the user interface for displaying roll summaries on action buttons for weapons, armor, and gear. The goal is to provide players with an at-a-glance understanding of their roll modifiers without needing to consult the full character sheet or hover for a tooltip. This enhances usability and speeds up gameplay.

## 2. Requirements

| ID     | Requirement                                                                      | Rationale                                                                      |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6.1.1  | Display a numeric summary of the total roll modifier next to the roll button.    | Provide immediate, visible feedback on the character's capabilities.           |
| 6.1.2  | The summary for non-damage rolls must be prefixed with a `+` sign.               | Clearly indicate that the value is a positive modifier to the dice roll.       |
| 6.1.3  | The damage roll summary must display the raw damage die string (e.g., "2d6+2").  | Damage is a distinct calculation and should not be presented as a modifier.   |
| 6.1.4  | The roll summary must appear to the right of the roll icon button.               | Maintain a clean, icon-first layout while providing the necessary information. |
| 6.1.5  | The summary must reactively update when underlying character stats change.       | Ensure the displayed information is always accurate and reflects the current state.|
| 6.1.6  | The "Use" action for Gear items should display a roll summary.                   | Standardize the presentation of rollable actions across all item types.        |
| 6.1.7  | Tooltips on roll buttons explaining the formula must be retained and unchanged.  | Preserve the existing method for players to inspect the detailed roll formula. |
