# Talent & Augment Template Fix - Completion Report

**Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Type**: Bug Fix Completion  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
Talents and Augments were incorrectly rendering the generic gear sheet template instead of their specialized layouts with AP selectors, tier fields, and other type-specific UI elements.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `AvantItemSheet` class was defaulting to `item-gear-sheet.html` in its static `PARTS` configuration. FoundryVTT's ApplicationV2 framework prioritizes static configuration over dynamic getters, so the specialized templates were never loaded.

## Solution Implemented
**Updated `scripts/sheets/item-sheet.ts`:**
- Changed `static PARTS` to point to the aggregator template `item-sheet.html`
- Updated `get template()` and `get parts()` to consistently return the aggregator path
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Template Architecture:**
- `item-sheet.html` serves as an aggregator that dynamically includes the correct partial based on `item.type`
- Partials like `item-talent-sheet.html` and `item-augment-sheet.html` contain the specialized UI elements
- This approach prevents accidental fallback to gear template

## Build & Deployment
✅ **Build**: `npm run build` completed successfully  
✅ **Validation**: All CI checks passed (path validation, partial validation, template validation)  
✅ **Deployment**: Files copied to FoundryVTT v13 container  
✅ **Container**: Restarted and running healthy at localhost:30000  

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to http://localhost:30000
2. Create a new Actor
3. Open the actor sheet and go to the Talents & Augments tab
4. Click "Add Talent" or "Add Augment"
5. **Expected Result**: Talent shows AP selector, tier fields, requirements field
6. **Expected Result**: Augment shows AP selector, PP cost, tier fields, requirements field

## Files Modified
- `avantVtt/scripts/sheets/item-sheet.ts` - Template configuration fix
- `avantVtt/changelogs/2025-01-17_talent_augment_template_fix.md` - Changelog

## Impact Assessment
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing weapon, armor, and gear sheets continue to work
- **Visual Enhancement**: Talents and Augments now display their proper specialized UI
- **UX Improvement**: Users can now properly configure AP costs, tiers, and requirements

## Next Steps
1. User testing to verify the fix works as expected
2. Monitor for any regressions in other item types
3. Consider adding automated UI tests for item sheet rendering
