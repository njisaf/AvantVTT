# Balanced Theme Manager - Final Deployment

**Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Time**: Final Deployment Complete  
**Target**: FoundryVTT v13 Container (localhost:30000)  
**Status**: BALANCED MODE - The Sweet Spot

## Deployment Summary

Successfully deployed the **BALANCED APPROACH** that finds the sweet spot between ultra-narrow and overly-broad theming. This approach should fully theme feature cards (including child elements) AND actor sheets while avoiding Foundry interface interference.

## The Balanced Solution

### **üéØ What Gets Themed**
1. **Feature Cards**: `.avant-feature-card` - Including ALL child elements
2. **Actor Sheets**: `.avant.sheet.actor` - Full sheet theming
3. **Item Sheets**: `.avant.sheet.item` - Full sheet theming

### **üö´ What Doesn't Get Themed**
- Foundry toolbar, sidebar, menus
- Other modules' interfaces
- Core Foundry dialogs and windows
- Non-Avant elements

## Key Improvements Made

### **1. Restored Actor Sheet Theming**
```javascript
// OLD (ultra-scoped): Only feature cards
const selectors = ['.avant-feature-card'];

// NEW (balanced): Feature cards + sheets
const selectors = [
    '.avant-feature-card',
    '.avant.sheet.actor', 
    '.avant.sheet.item'
];
```

### **2. Enhanced Feature Card Child Element Theming**
Now targets specific child elements within feature cards:
- `.feature-title` (title text)
- `.feature-type` (type pills/badges)
- `.feature-content` (content area)
- `h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6` (all headers)
- `p, span, div` (text elements)
- `.chip, .pill, .badge` (pills and badges)
- `*` (all child elements as fallback)

### **3. Smart Element Detection**
- Different child element strategies for feature cards vs sheets
- Enhanced mutation observer for both element types
- Balanced application window scanning

### **4. Enhanced Logging**
All logs now show **"BALANCED MODE"** for clear identification:
- `"Applying theme: dark (BALANCED MODE)"`
- `"BALANCED MutationObserver started (FEATURE CARDS + SHEETS)"`
- Child element count logging for feature cards

## Technical Implementation

### **Build Process ‚úÖ**
- **Build Time**: 546ms (optimized TypeScript compilation)
- **File Size**: 1.91MB deployment package
- **Validation**: All 7 paths validated, all templates valid
- **Artifacts**: 17 compendium items generated

### **Deployment Process ‚úÖ**
- **Files Deployed**: Successfully copied to foundry-vtt-v13
- **Container Status**: Restarted and healthy
- **Access Point**: localhost:30000

### **Enhanced Child Element Targeting**
For feature cards specifically:
```javascript
if (element.classList.contains('avant-feature-card')) {
    const featureCardSelectors = [
        '.feature-header', '.feature-title', '.feature-type',
        '.feature-content', '.feature-description', '.feature-cost',
        'h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6', 'p, span, div',
        '.chip, .pill, .badge', '*'
    ];
    // Apply theme variables to all child elements
}
```

## Expected Behavior

### **‚úÖ Should Be Fully Themed**
- **Feature Cards**: Background, text, titles, type pills, all content
- **Actor Sheets**: Full sheet including tabs, content, forms
- **Item Sheets**: Full sheet including forms and content

### **‚ùå Should NOT Be Themed**
- Foundry core interface (toolbar, sidebar, menus)
- Other modules' UI elements
- Chat input/controls (only feature cards within chat)
- System dialogs and popups

## Success Criteria

This balanced approach should resolve the user's specific concerns:

1. **‚úÖ Feature Card Child Elements**: Text, titles, and pills should now be properly themed
2. **‚úÖ Actor Sheet Theming**: Restored full actor sheet theming capability
3. **‚úÖ No Broad Interface Theming**: Avoids the full-window theming issue
4. **‚úÖ Improved Reliability**: Enhanced child element targeting for completeness

## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to**: localhost:30000
2. **Test Feature Cards**:
   - Post talents/augments to chat
   - Verify background, text, titles, and type pills are all themed
3. **Test Actor Sheets**:
   - Open character sheets
   - Verify full sheet theming (tabs, content, forms)
4. **Test Theme Switching**:
   - Switch between Dark/Light themes
   - Verify immediate application to both feature cards and sheets
5. **Verify No Interference**:
   - Confirm Foundry toolbar/sidebar remain unthemed
   - Test other modules for interference

## Debug Information

The console will show enhanced logging:
- `"BALANCED MODE"` indicators throughout
- Child element counts for feature cards
- Specific element type detection logging
- Clear targeting information

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Surgical Precision**: Targets exactly what we want themed
2. **Enhanced Coverage**: Ensures child elements get proper theming
3. **Future-Proof**: Extensible for additional element types
4. **Performance**: Efficient targeting without broad DOM scanning
5. **Maintainable**: Clear separation between feature cards and sheets

**Status: READY FOR BALANCED TESTING** ‚öñÔ∏è

This balanced approach should provide the "sweet spot" between functionality and precision that you requested!
